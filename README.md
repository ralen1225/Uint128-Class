# Uint128-Class<br>
128-bit unsigned integer class<br>
  Formed by combining 2 64-bit unsigned integers<br>
  Includes all operators and ctype definitions<br>
  
Having trouble with multiplication and division operators.<br>
  Ended up brute-forcing multiplication using nested loops.<br>
  If anyone knows a better algorithm for multiplication,<br>
  I'm open to suggestions.<br>
  I used a shift algorithm for division. By that point I was<br>
  just happy to fill the spot.<br>
