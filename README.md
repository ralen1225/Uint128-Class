# Uint128-Class<br>
128-bit unsigned integer class<br>
  Formed by combining 2 64-bit unsigned integers<br>
  Includes all operators and ctype definitions<br>
  
Having trouble with multiplication and division operators.<br>
  Ended up brute-forcing multiplication using nested loops.<br>
  I ended up using a shift algorithm for division.<br>
